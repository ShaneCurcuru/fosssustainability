## FOSS Backstage 2024: Who Funds FOSS Foundations?

Welcome - this is a page of notes and references for my [FOSS Backstage](https://24.foss-backstage.de/about/) talk in Berlin about "[Who Funds FOSS Foundations?](https://24.foss-backstage.de/sessions/?id=WNHFDT)"  Most links here are to open source sites that appreciate your contributions!

**Questions?**  I'm @ShaneCurcuru on social media.

## Session Topics

I'll be covering *three* topics in my talk, and while I know it will be informative, I hope to leave attendees with a number of much more focused questions for them to think about around sustainability.

### Aspects of Sustainability

Reading about people talking about sustainability, I was struck by how conversations felt very siloed depending on the experience and role of the person writing.  I wonder: is there some way we can [quantify or categorize the different roles of people](https://fosssustainability.com/aspects/) in the software ecosystem, so that when we talk about sustainability, we can translate larger frameworks into the context of that person's role?

I've proposed set of roles or groups - like contributors, maintainers, or software companies - is provided.  Being able to map the concerns from each group *in their own terms* into some larger taxonomy of sustainability terms can help both with research efforts, and with education.  I call these [Aspects Of Sustainability](https://fosssustainability.com/aspects/).

I'm really hoping to get feedback across the ecosystem of how to make this valuable.

### Modeling Foundation Sponsorship Programs

Most hosting foundations have sponsorship models, where corporations can donate a certain amount, and get some benefits.  The benefits and amounts different foundations 'charge' vary widely.  I've built a [model of sponsorship programs](https://github.com/Punderthings/fossfoundation/blob/main/_data/p990/foundations_990_common.csv), and mapped actual sponsorship prospectuses to the model for a number of popular foundations.

### Comparative Financials of US Nonprofit Foundations

US nonprofits all file 990 tax forms, meaning we have consistent, if high-level, income and expense data for them all.  Let's go on a journey of a handful of the major FOSS Foundations that host multiple projects, and see both what they do for projects, and how much the make and spend.

Note that US 990 tax filings take a long time to show up publicly, so data is always a year or so back.  Also, I'm still looking for effective ways to evaluate EU charities' finances.

## Thanks and Credits

This presentation is based on my [Who Pays For FOSS Foundations?](https://shaneslides.com/2023/10/FOSS-Foundation-Funding/) slide deck, but is completely reworked with new data and concepts for the FOSS Backstage crowd.

Thanks to all the open source communities that have helped out along the way!
