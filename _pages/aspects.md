Discussing *open source sustainability* with any four people will quickly bring up a dozen different conversations, based on how each person is related to open source.  To keep conversations productive, it helps to define what *aspects* of sustainability you're considering.

Even if we confine sustainability to just "common open source projects", the important points may be **very** different for someone working in a software company, versus a lone maintainer, versus anyone else.  This site offers a framework of major aspects to consider when working on sustainability to help provide context.

Some key aspects - or different ways to think about sustainability - are:

- [FOSS Foundations](/aspects/foundation/)
- [Project Maintainers](/aspects/maintainer/)
- [Governments and agencies](/aspects/government/)
- [Non Governmental Organizations](/aspects/ngo/)
- Open Source Contributors
- Open Source Program Offices
- Software Companies
- Commercial Companies (of all kinds)
- Funders and Grantmaking Orgs
- Universities and Educational Orgs
