Every computer user is using open source software.  The important question is: does the user know what open source is?  Does the user know how important open source components are to their computer's functioning?  

While users are rarely involved directly in open source projects, some users end up becoming contributors.  Similarly, users who know of the importance for open source have the chance to help advocate for sustainability topics in open source, even outside of the typical "buy a software license" realm.
