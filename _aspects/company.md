Corporations outside of the software space are still major consumers of software, and in some cases do contribute back to open source projects.  While they are not usually as engaged as software-producing companies, most larger corporations do have some level of contribution back to open source projects they use.

Besides the ecosystem and type of company (i.e. relation to technology internally), a critical factor in sustainability here is awareness of the open source impact.  Companies that are aware of the breadth of open source technology they consume can be good contributors back to communities.
