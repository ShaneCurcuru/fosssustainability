Many projects at foundations and some independent projects have Project Management Committees (PMC) or similarly named Technical Management Committee groups.  These groups are documented and recognized as being in charge of project direction and major technical decisions, as well as deciding who gets to join the PMC or body of committers.

Many of the same aspects of Maintainers apply to PMCs; however the emphasis here is on the *collective* ownership of responsibility as a whole group or committee.  The individuals are typically less important in perception than the group as a whole, which is often expected to change over time.
