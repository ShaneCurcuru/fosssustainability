Contributors are the lifeblood of any project.  Contributors submit new code, patch bugs, write or edit documentation, and answer questions about projects.  Contributors may have some smaller roles in strategic project governance, but not the responsibility of a maintainer or PMC member.  Contributors come from around the world and from every kind of person.

Every individual who directly or indirectly submits work (code, docs, whatever) to a project can be thought of as a contributor.  Many contributors come and go within one or more projects.  Some contributors make a habit of contributing to specific projects on a regular basis.  Regular contributors are often made into committers, or people with direct write access to project resources.

Cultivating a steady flow of new contributors to a project is a key factor in individual project sustainability.
