Education's importance to sustainability is everywhere: from core STEM concepts teaching in lower grades, to traditional university curricula related to software or technology fields, to non-traditional places that people can learn about software or open source concepts.

- **Research** Institutions are starting to work on real research into sustainability topics specifically in the open source space.
- **Contributions** Many academic groups find that contributing their code to open source directly helps them meet scientific goals around sharing information.
- **Grant Funding** Higher education institutions often manage grant funding of a variety of projects, and some institutions have policies to ensure their work is made open source in some way.
- **Education** Institutions are starting to truly teach open source concepts - not just software engineering, but how open source is a process and method for driving innovation in distributed communities.
