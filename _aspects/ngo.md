A wide variety of NGOs in technical spaces set the de facto (or de jure) standards that affect software in many ways.

- **Policy setting** The IEEE, W3C, ISO and many other NGOs set the policy standards that much of the world relies on for how software is built, is used, and many other aspects.  NGOs often write or influence standards set by government legislation as well.
- **Software contributions** Many technical NGOs like the W3C directly build or contribute to important software that defines or validates operation to their standards.
- **Grant funding** Some NGOs host events, papers, or other grant-based work that directly contributes either to their standards or even to software implementations.
