Companies that create any sorts of software products are a critical part of any FOSS sustainability discussion.  Commercial companies rely on a wide variety of open source products in both their daily work and directly in products they sell.  How and when software companies contribute material work back to open source projects is a major driver of both maintenance and innovation.

Software companies vary widely in their knowledge of FOSS and their internal policies that govern how their employees contribute to open source.  

- **Funding** Most major software companies sponsor multiple Foundations, and also provide funding in various ways for events, project maintenance, and in-kind donations of services like cloud credits.
- **Contributions** Software companies are often built around core open source projects, and in some areas are the major contributors (through their paid employees) to those projects.
- **Events** Companies often manage and promote events that provide key networking and learning opportunities for open source projects.
- **Education** Dev Rel and some marketing activities at companies focus on the underlying open source projects, which provides educational and outreach opportunities for those projects.
