Non-profit foundations provide services for one or more open source projects.  Many foundations directly host project communities, giving them both a legal, fiscal, organizational, and sometimes structured home separate from the individual developers.  Some foundations provide a more hands-off set of services, often involving fiscal pass-through of fundraising monies.

Foundations are typically distinct from traditional software companies in terms of governance.  Foundations typically have boards and bylaws that focus on the needs of their project communities or the vendors investing in that ecosystem - not shareholders.
