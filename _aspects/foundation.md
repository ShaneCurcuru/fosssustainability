## Sustainability Aspects

Foundations **care** about community health, and legal and fiscal risks to their own projects.

Foundations **include** many of the key people who are technical and organizational leaders in the software ecosystem.

Foundations **are open** in much of their governance and activities; this can help serve as examples for sustainability work and research.

## FOSS Foundations

Non-profit foundations provide services for one or more open source projects.  Many [FOSS foundations directly host project communities](https://fossfoundation.info/), giving them both a legal, fiscal, organizational, and sometimes structured home separate from the individual developers.  Some foundations provide a more hands-off set of services, often involving fiscal pass-through of fundraising monies.

Foundations are typically distinct from traditional software companies in terms of governance.  Foundations (non-profit ones at least) typically have boards and bylaws that focus on the needs of their project communities or the vendors investing in that ecosystem - not shareholders.  Key aspects to foundations include:

- **Governance** Some foundations like the ASF and Eclipse provide governance models and mentoring for hosted project communities.
- **Trademark and IP Ownership** Foundations may be the legal owner for trademarks, copyrights, and other project IP, ensuring that individual maintainers are not directly responsible.
- **Fundraising** Most foundations either act as fundraising hosts, or provide additional resources for the projects to do fundraising themselves.
- **Funding** Some foundations may provide inherent funding or otherwise handle providing funding directly to project work.
- **Technical Infrastructure** Foundations provide domain name ownership, additional cloud and build resources, and often infrastructure or DevOps paid staff that can provide various build and hosting services to hosted projects.
- **Community Management** Most foundations either have direct community management and mentoring services, or provide a shared environment where hosted projects can find volunteers to assist in these tasks.
- **Legal Liability Shield** Many foundations serve as the official publisher of code, providing some levels of legal liability capture in the organization rather than individuals submitting code.

## Sustainability Questions

How can foundations focus their efforts on broader sustainability issues?  For volunteer-run foundations, it's often difficult to find the time to build larger programs that focus outside their project(s).

How do we model the project services of foundations?  Over at [ChooseAFoundation](http://chooseafoundation.com/) there's a brief guide between some popular foundations, but what if we could provide a richer model of services provided to new communities?
