Non-profit foundations provide services for one or more open source projects.  Many foundations directly host project communities, giving them both a legal, fiscal, organizational, and sometimes structured home separate from the individual developers.  Some foundations provide a more hands-off set of services, often involving fiscal pass-through of fundraising monies.

Foundations are typically distinct from traditional software companies in terms of governance.  Foundations typically have boards and bylaws that focus on the needs of their project communities or the vendors investing in that ecosystem - not shareholders.  Key aspects to foundations include:

- **Governance** Some foundations like the ASF and Eclipse provide governance models and mentoring for hosted project communities.
- **Trademark and IP Ownership** Foundations may be the legal owner for trademarks, copyrights, and other project IP, ensuring that individual maintainers are not directly responsible.
- **Fundraising** Most foundations either act as fundraising hosts, or provide additional resources for the projects to do fundraising themselves.
- **Funding** Some foundations may provide inherent funding or otherwise handle providing funding directly to project work.
- **Technical Infrastructure** Foundations provide domain name ownership, additional cloud and build resources, and often infrastructure or DevOps paid staff that can provide various build and hosting services to hosted projects.
- **Community Management** Most foundations either have direct community management and mentoring services, or provide a shared environment where hosted projects can find volunteers to assist in these tasks.
- **Legal Liability Shield** Many foundations serve as the official publisher of code, providing some levels of legal liability capture in the organization rather than individuals submitting code.
