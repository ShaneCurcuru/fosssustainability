A main objective of this work is ensuring that we can efficiently maintain all the software that makes the modern world run for the long term.  Ecosystem stability is a top goal: can we make open source models and various software practices more efficient in how they keep computers running, and to a degree, continue to be an innovation engine.

## Sustainability Questions

How do we discuss "keep computers working efficiently" in ways that appeals to each aspect?  What's in this work for me, the maintainer; or me, the VC company looking for profit?  Why does the average company even care about this stuff; they just hire someone to keep the servers running as a cost of business.

How do we balance the overall security and stability of software (i.e. secure and easy to fix & update supply chains) with the social and economic goals of paying the maintainers, and showing profitable business models that also respect those maintainers?
