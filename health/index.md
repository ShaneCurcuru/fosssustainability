## How Do We Measure Project Health?

When considering a single FOSS project community, we can consider the health of the project as a whole as a proxy for how to think about sustainability.  One ACM paper[^1] describes health as the "project’s capability to stay viable and maintained over time without interruption or weakening.".  In the majority of FOSS cases, this also means that the community of maintainers (of whatever kind) also continues, and presumably grows to include new contributors as past ones drift away from a project.


## Key Organizations / Tools Measuring Health

- [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) is a community project at the Linux Foundation creating models and metrics about FOSS projects' health and more, and builds the [Grimoire Lab toolset](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/).
- [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/) is a software vendor building a number of project health tools that are also useful in FOSS.
- [Cauldron](https://cauldron.io/) is a paid service that provides an analytics as-a-service platform.
- Several groups have defined useful if simplistic manual checklists for project health, like [VMWare](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-engagement/blob/main/HEALTHCHECKS.md) and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/open-source-project-health-checklist).
- The ASF has a [Maturity Model for Apache Projects](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html), where many factors are applicable for any community-led project.
- The Linux Foundation [Insights platform provides dashboard health metrics](https://insights-v2.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects) for their projects.
- FOSS Backstage: [A Strategic Approach to Assessing Viability of OSS Projects](https://24.foss-backstage.de/sessions/?id=3DHGWR), Dawn Foster
