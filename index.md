## What Is Open Source Sustainability?

Open source is built by individuals from around the world - some of whom are not paid a wage _(or anything!)_ for their work.  "Open Source Sustainability" is a movement to change the software ecosystem - contributors and users alike - to ensure better financial sustainability for the people and organizations who build the open source software the world relies on.

## What Is "Pay The Maintainers" All About?

Some critical open source projects used across the web are maintained by small teams of unpaid individuals.  The [maintainers](/aspects/maintainer/) are the ones in charge of a project's repository and making new releases - either to fix bugs, or address security issues.  "Paying the maintainers" means finding ways to compensate maintainers for this often unpaid labor.

## How Else Can I Think About Sustainability?

Sustainability of open source touches on many, many different realms of thought and action, and is a new field for many practitioners.  Reviewing the [key aspects of sustainability](/aspects/) provides a framework to understand different areas of sustainability.  The kinds of issues and factors that a sole maintainer cares about may be very different than those of a [foundation](/aspects/foundation/), or an academic researcher thinking about long-term ecosystem health.
