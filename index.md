## What Is Open Source Sustainability?

Open source is built by individuals from around the world - may of whom are not paid a wage - or anything! - for their work.  "Open Source Sustainability" is a movement to change the software ecosystem - builders and users alike - to ensure better financial sustainability for the people who build the most important FOSS projects we all rely on.

## What Is "Pay The Maintainers" All About?

Some critical open source projects used across the web are maintained by small teams of unpaid individuals.  The maintainers are the ones in charge of a project's repository and making new releases - either to fix bugs, or address security issues.  "Paying the maintainers" means finding ways to compensate maintainers for this unpaid labor.
